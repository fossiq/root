# .copilot Documentation

AI agent documentation for Expedition project. These files maintain continuity between sessions.

## Files

- **`instructions.md`** - General project guidelines, code style, workflow
- **`kql-parser/`** - KQL parser specific documentation
  - `implementation-guide.md` - Step-by-step operator implementation
  - `architecture.md` - System structure and patterns
  - `status.md` - Feature checklist and current state

## Usage

1. Read `instructions.md` for general guidelines
2. For parser work, read files in `kql-parser/`
3. **After completing features:** Update relevant docs with what you learned

## Why This Exists

AI agents have no memory between sessions. Without these docs:

- Patterns get forgotten
- Mistakes get repeated
- Architectural decisions get lost
- Knowledge doesn't accumulate

## Documentation Rules

- Be specific (file paths, function names, commands)
- Provide code examples
- Keep it concise
- Update after every feature
